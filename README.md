# ES-Mod-Share
Mod sharing website for Endless Sky

You may have to give the website permission to show dialog boxes. Using Google Chrome is strongly recommended.
You can add a mod by going to the js folder and editing the mods file, you can see how mods are added and some info. It's pretty simple, and a tutorial will be added later.
