description: >
  Endless Sky is a 2D space trading and combat game similar to the classic Escape Velocity series. 
  Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. 
  Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. 
  Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own.
