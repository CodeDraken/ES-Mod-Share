title: "Tribute & Domination"
author: "Legolas @CodeDraken"
description: "Increased tribute reward, demand tribute from every planet, conquer any system and start your own faction.

You can demand tribute from every planet, ring world, station, and any kind of sh*thole with something living in it.

You can conquer any system after demanding tribute from all the planets / stations in it.

For modders: You can easily build on the conquering / player government system adding things like upgrades, missions, and whatever you want."
